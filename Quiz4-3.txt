     When you are complete, with any part, please raise your hand, so we may visually inspect that part.

     The second part of the test, you should electronically submit, you will need to copy and paste 
     only those lines of code to implement that part of the test, usually a few (two to eight) lines of code. 
     Place it immediately after the question.

     Submit this Quiz (renamed) with code cut and pasted, ONLY text. DO NOT submit zips, binaries, libraries,

 2. Get files from this same folder.
   
 3. Name your program/submission with your name and last digits of your ID.

 4. Using the cloud services provider, all functionality possible should be implemented on that provider.
    (Of course, displaying web pages through a browser and the user interface is "local")
    The cloud service provider is MS Azure.

 4+ In order to give as many people the opportunity to demo in the last few minutes, you may only demo ONE Question in the
    last 5 minutes of the quiz time or for the few minutes afterward. 
  
Show and submit code, when each part is complete, raise your hand and then show us:

 5. Upload the .csv data file to cloud service. Once it is in the cloud service you will import it into
    SQL tables, created and indexed as necessary (for the following parts).
    The voting (.csv) are the states (in alphabetical order, from Alabama to Wyoming, 
    including Washington DC), total state population, voting population, number registered voters, 
    the number who actually did vote, all in thousands (the values have 000 appended at the end).
    Please create SQL tables with the information in the dataset.
    Show a web page and interface (which resides on the cloud provider) with your student ID followed by your
    last name then comma then first name (as it appears on your student ID), in large font at the top of every web page displayed 
    (for this quiz)
    On the same web page show the names of all states with a total population between 5 to 10 million and 
    then between 10 million and 50 million.
	@app.route('/')
def home():
	result = []
	query = "SELECT * FROM voting where TotalPop between 500 and 1000 "
	con = sql.connect("database.db") 
	cur = con.cursor()
	cur.execute(query)
	rows = cur.fetchall()
	query = "SELECT * FROM voting where TotalPop between 1000 and 5000 "
	con = sql.connect("database.db") 
	cur = con.cursor()
	cur.execute(query)
	result = cur.fetchall()
	return render_template('home.html',rows = rows,data = result)
	
	<!doctype html>
<html>
	<body>

		<center>
		<header> <h1> Home </h1> </header>
		<header> <h1> Thiruvathilingam, Shakthi Prakash </h1> </header>
		<header> <h1> 1001518112</h1> </header>
		<br> Between 5 and 10
			{% for row in rows %}
			{{row[1]}} <br>
			{% endfor %}
			<br>
			<br>
			Between 10 and 50 
			{% for row in data %}
			{{row[1]}} <br>
			{% endfor %}
	</body>
</html>

 6. Show a pie chart for percent voted, that is, total population/voted (2nd column divided by last column)
    from  to 40 to 80 percent in groups of N percent, where we will give you N in a web form, 
    (for example if N is 20, then 40 to 60 percent, 60 to 80 percent), where each pie section will show how many states 
    are in that group. Please show the pie sections in different colors and put the label (that is the group, for example,
    "40-60", "60-80") outside the pie section and the pie part size (that is the number of states, or the percent of states,
    inside that pie section.) The pie chart should be between 70% and 95% of the width of your display.

 7. For the formula x=y*y+1 (that is, x = y squared plus 1), for the values of y between N1 and N2, where y is an integer,
    please show a point chart or a scatter chart. The x axis should be horizontal, and the y vertical. 
    The axis (or all points) should be labeled with values. The user will give the values of N1 and N2, the increment is always 1.
    (For example, N1 might be 1, and N2 is 4, so the values for y, will be 1, 2, 3, and 4, the corresponding x are 2, 5, 10, 17)
    The axis should be labeled, and the plot should occupy between 70% and 95% of the width of your display.

 8. Create a vertical bar graph that shows the total registered for all states (ie, the number of states) for in groups of N
    (millions), (for example if N is 10, then 1 to 10 million, 10 to 20 million, 20 to 30 million, etc)
    The bars should be labeled, and the chart should occupy between 70% and 95% of the width of your display,
    show legend (amounts) inside each bar.
 
 9. Show GTA parts 5, 6, 7, 8

 10. When complete, return (send) this quiz
     If you finish early, send this immediately, otherwise send between
     the end of class and no more than 1 minute after that.
